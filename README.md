# Sphinx Example Project

I am experimenting with automated documentation... Since I wasn't able to find a real Sphinx Project I tried myself on this one and I plan to extend it.
I was struggling with the file structure and its appearance within the docs as I may not be the only one, maybe someone else finds this usefull.

## Requirements
+ Follow the [main instructions](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html) and then come back here
+ This example aims at Python documentation and so [numpydoc](https://codeandchaos.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/sphinx-and-numpydoc/) is the best solution for pythonic docstrings.

## whats inside?
This example project has small but not so unreal data structure with just-laying-around-files and files in a folder with multiple classes. To ease the understanding the **doc** directory holds the same structure - apart from the directories Sphinx builds.


## Todo
+ a nice and clean makefile that includes the 'sphinx-apidoc' reference to incorporate all files
+ might need a small script part that inserts the outcome in the right files!


### hmmm...
its possible that i just didn't google right or my pc at work restricts certain things...
